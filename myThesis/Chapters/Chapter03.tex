The \ac{LHC} is unique in the world, producing proton-proton collisions at energies an order of magnitude higher than any accelerator before. It provides unique environments at its collision points where massive, unstable particles can exist for an instant, then decay to the ordinary material of the universe. It is the goal of the ATLAS experiment to identify these short-lived particles, but \ac{LHC}'s work of producing them is equally complex.
