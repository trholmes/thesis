\section{Uncertainties on Data-Driven Backgrounds}

\subsection{Uncertainties on the Flavor Symmetry Method}
\label{sec:unc_fs}

The flavor symmetry method is a data driven method that makes its primarily on based events populating an \ac{SR}-like \ac{CR} in the different-flavor channel. The statistical uncertainty on these events makes up the dominant uncertainty on the method. To reduce this uncertainty, the \mll range on the \ac{CR} is expanded, tripling the number of events in CR-FS. Though this reduces the statistical uncertainty significantly, it is still significantly higher than any of the other systematic uncertainties on this method, as seen in \autoref{tab:fs_errors}. Also included in the statistical uncertainty column is the uncertainty on the number of non-\ac{FS} events in CR-FS, which is used to scale the prediction to remove any contamination in the \ac{CR}.

 \caption{
   Uncertainties in the on-Z signal and validation regions. Nominal predictions are given with statistical uncertainty (including uncertainty from subtracted backgrounds), MC Closure uncertainty, uncertainty on the prediction from varying k and $\alpha$ by their statistical uncertainties, comparing the efficiencies from AODs to that of DAODs, and on the \mll widening, which includes MC statistics and a data/MC comparison in a loosened region.

\end{table}

The next largest contribution to the uncertainty comes from \ac{MC} closure tests. In this test, the entire \ac{FS} procedure is performed on \ttbar \ac{MC}, including a regeneration of weighting factors $\alpha$ and $k$. The prediction from $e\mu$ events in \ac{MC} is compared to the \ac{MC} $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ events, as seen in \autoref{fig:fs_closure}. The difference between the two predictions is then summed in quadrature with the statistical uncertainty on each prediction to give the total closure uncertainty seen in \autoref{tab:fs_errors}.
