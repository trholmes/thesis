The \ac{SM} of particle physics represents all particles and interactions currently understood by the particle physics community. It is formulated using the principles of Quantum Field Theory, with the constraints of several symmetries and physical requirements to determine the rules for allowed interactions. \cite{Burgess:2007zi} Developed in the 1960s and 70s, it has been immensely successful at predicting additional particles, and has held up to many high-precision tests. Despite this success, it has several shortcomings which point to its incompleteness. Though the \ac{SM} is likely correct at the energies thus far probed, it may be missing key components that become more important at higher energies. Models supplementing the \ac{SM} with additional particles and interactions are referred to as \ac{BSM} theories. 

One possible extention of the \ac{SM} is \ac{SUSY}, a theory which applies an additional symmetry between bosons and fermions to the \ac{SM}, creating a spectrum of \ac{SUSY} particles (sparticles) which interact with the particles of the \ac{SM}. This theory motivates the search performed in \autoref{part:search}, and its theoretical appeals are discussed in this section, along with specific simplified models considered in the search.

\section{The Standard Model}
\label{sec:standard_model}
The \ac{SM} of particle physics describes the interactions of all of the particles currently known to exist, and consists of both matter particles and force carriers. This model has been unprecidentedly successful in predicting new particles and phenomena, including the prediction of the Higgs particle almost 50 years before its discovery in 2012, which completed the \ac{SM}. This section describes the components of the \ac{SM} and how they interact, focusing on the environment of the \ac{LHC}. 

The particles of the \ac{SM} are divided into two categories: fermions and bosons. The fermions comprise all the matter described by the \ac{SM}, and are spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles. The bosons, integer-spin particles, are the force carriers. They provide a mechanism to explain three of the four forces known to particle physics, with gravity still lacking a quantum formuliziation. The Higgs boson, the only spin-0 particle in the \ac{SM}, provides a mechanism for giving mass to the other particles. The full \ac{SM}, with the addition of the hypothetical graviton, is presented in \autoref{fig:sm}.

\subsection{Matter}

The matter described by the \ac{SM} is made up of fermions, spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles which can be broken into two groups, quarks and leptons. The leptons all interact weakly, while the quarks additionally interact strongly. 

\subsubsection{Leptons}

Leptons, as seen in the bottom left of \autoref{fig:sm}, come in three generations, each labeled by a flavor: electron, muon, and tau. In the case of the massive leptons, these flavors are mass eigenstates, and the generations are placed in an order based on increasing mass. Each massive lepton is negatively charged and has a positively charged anti-particle. 

The three neutrinos come in the same flavors as the massive leptons, but these flavor eigenstates do not correspond exactly to mass eigenstates. As a consequence, neutrinos oscillate between flavors as they propagate through space. These oscillations are the only evidence of neutrino mass, which is bound from below by the mass splittings determined from the oscillation. Though it is still uncertain if the masses of the neutrinos follow the same hierarchy as the massive leptons, that expected ordering is slightly preferred over the inverted hierarchy. \cite{Huang:2016} 

Unlike the massive leptons, the neutrinos are uncharged, and it is not yet known whether each neutrino has a separate anti-particle, or if it is its own antiparticle. Because they are uncharged, they can only interact weakly, making them extremely difficult to detect. In the ATLAS detector, neutrinos pass through all layers undetected, and their presence can only be inferred from the non-conservation of momentum that results in the observed particles. As a consequence of their ability to evade detection, neutrinos are the least understood particles of the \ac{SM}. 

The \ac{SM} conserves lepton number, $L$, which is defined as the number of leptons minus the number of anti-leptons in a state. While this conservation is not theoretically required, its violation has not yet been observed. As a consequence of this conservation, the lightest massive lepton, the electron, is stable.

\subsubsection{Quarks}

Quarks, as seen in the top left of \autoref{fig:sm}, are also charged particles that interact weakly, but are differentiated from the leptons by their strong interactions. They are also organized in three generations ordered by mass, and come in pairs of ``up-type'' and ``down-type'' quarks, named after the lightest generation. Though the up quark is lighter than the down, that rule is reversed in the subsequent two generations. Up-type quarks are charged $+\frac{2}{3}$, while the down-type quarks are charged $-\frac{1}{3}$. Quarks are also charged under the strong interaction, whose three charges are often characterized by colors: red, green, and blue. Each quark has an anti-particle with the opposite charges. 

These fractional charges and individual colors are never seen in nature because of the requirement (discussed further in \autoref{sec:strong}) that stable particle states be color-neutral. To accomplish this, quarks can create two-particle bound states called \textit{mesons} consisting of one quark and one anti-quark with the same color charge or three-particle bound states of quarks or anti-quarks with the three different color charges, which are called \textit{baryons}. The lightest color neutral state containing only quarks, the proton ($uud$), is stable. Extremely unstable bound states consisting of higher numbers of quarks can also exist, such as the pentaquark discovered in 2015 at the \ac{LHC}. \cite{Pentaquark} Collectively, these multi-quark bound states are called \textit{hadrons}. 

Like leptons, the number of quarks in a state is conserved. However, because quarks cannot exist in an isolated state, that conservation described as a conservation of baryon number ($B$) defined similarly to lepton number. Mesons, because they have one quark and one anti-quark, have $B = 0$. 

\subsection{Forces}

The fermions in the previous section interact via the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, which are each mediated by their own bosonic force carriers. These mediator particles interact only with particles charged with their corresponding force's quantum numbers. The photon, for example, interacts only with electromagnetically charged particles. Gluons, mediators of the strong force, interact only with quarks and other gluons. All fermions are weakly charged and interact with the $W$ and $Z$ bosons. 

The electromagnetic and weak forces, which originally were conceived as independent mechanisms, were later unified into one theory, and are together called the \textit{electroweak} force.

\label{sec:pp_collisions}

As discussed in \autoref{ch:lhc}, the \ac{LHC} collides bunches of high-energy protons, and interactions of these protons' constituent quarks produce the wide array of particles seen in the ATLAS detector.
