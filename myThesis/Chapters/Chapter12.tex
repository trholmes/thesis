Using the simplified models discussed in \autoref{sec:simplified_models}, these results can be interpreted as exclusions of Supersymmetric particles with particular mass ranges. Of course, these exclusions include all the assumptions of the models used, so they shouldn't be interpreted to mean that no theory with a given set of particle masses can possibly exist, but they do provide a helpful guideline for targeting future searches and comparing results from different analyses.

Limits are determined using a program called HistFitter \cite{Baak:2014wma}, designed within the \ac{ATLAS} experiment, which builds upon the capabilities of ROOT \cite{BRUN199781}, RooStats \cite{1009.1003}, and HistFactory \cite{Cranmer:2012sba} to combine the uncertainties of the various background predictions, including their correlations, and produce $p$-values and cross-section limits at 95\% \ac{CL} using the $CL_{\text{S}}$ prescription~\cite{statforumlimits,clsread}. In this prescription, a likelihood is constructed based on the expected signal and background contributions to the \ac{SR}. Nuisance parameters are created based on the statistical and systematic uncertainties for each data-driven background, as well as for each systematic error applied to the \ac{MC}-driven background estimates. The fit uses Gaussian models for nuisance parameters for all signal and background uncertainties, except for the statistical uncertainty on data- and \ac{MC}-driven background estimates, which are interpreted as Poissonian. Experimental uncertainties are considered fully correlated across the signal and background \ac{MC}-based estimates. 

A fit is performed, leaving a signal strength parameter ($\mu$) free, to maximize the likelihood, and subsequent fits are preformed at discrete $\mu$ values to determine the relative likelihood of each value. Using this relative likelihood, the probability of a background-only hypothesis, $p_b$, can be determined by setting $\mu=0$, as well as the probability of a signal + background hypothesis $p_{s+b}$ with any non-zero signal strength, but nominally with $\mu=1$. The confidence limit is constructed as a ratio

\begin{equation}
CL_S = \frac{p_{s+b}}{1-p_b} , 
\end{equation}

which considers not only the agreement of a signal + background hypothesis, but also the agreement with the background-only hypothesis. In this way, an observation that agrees with neither hypothesis will have a weakened exclusion on the signal + background hypothesis, and strong exclusions can only made when the backgrounds are well understood.

Then, if $CL_S$ falls below 5\%, the signal + background hypothesis can be excluded at 95\%. Expected exclusion limits are constructed by assuming the observed data precisely matches the prediction, and 1$\sigma$ uncertainty bands are formed by varying the nuisance parameters away from their fitted values to produce a change in the likelihood. The observed limit uses the actual observation of data in the \ac{SR} to set exclusion limits, so any excess above the expected background will result in worse limits than expected, and any deficit will result in better limits. This exclusion is typically displayed with error bands that represent a 1$\sigma$ variation in the cross-section of the signal models. 

The simplified model discussed in \autoref{sec:simplified_models}, in which pair-produced gluinos decay via a $\chitwozero$ to jets, a $Z$ boson, and a $\chionezero$ \ac{LSP}, is produced in two grids, which differ by their choice of the \ac{LSP} mass. The first grid assumes a light \ac{LSP}, fixing its mass to 1 \gev~for all mass points, and is shown as a function of the masses of $\tilde{g}$ and $\chitwozero$. The second grid is defined as a function of the masses of $\tilde{g}$ and $\chionezero$, and its varying \ac{LSP} mass is defined relative to the $\chitwozero$ mass by $m(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}) = m(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}) - 100 \gev$. This mass difference is chosen to be slightly above the $Z$ mass, which in most models creates the largest branching ratio to the $Z$ boson. \autoref{fig:excl_SMGGN2_1} shows the first of these grids, along with exclusions on a similar simplified model, which replaces the gluinos with squarks and uses the same mass scheme. The exclusion contours on the second grid is shown in \autoref{fig:excl_SMGGN2}, as a function of $m(\tilde{g})$ and $m(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1})$.

In the two grids displayed in \autoref{fig:excl_SMGGN2_1} as a function of the mass of $\chitwozero$, the exclusion extends all the way to the $m(\go) = m(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2})$ line superimposed on the plot. At this limit, the similar masses of the $\go$ and $\chitwozero$ result in a $\chitwozero$ being produced with a very small \pt. However, because the mass of the $\chionezero$ is fixed to 1 \gev, there is still enough energy in the system to produce a $Z$ boson and a $\chionezero$ with significant \pt values, leading to high \met and lepton \pt. In the grid shown in \autoref{fig:excl_SMGGN2}, the $\chionezero$ mass is instead fixed to a value 100 \gev~less than that of the $\chitwozero$, so a $\chitwozero$ produced at rest has just enough energy to decay to a $Z$ boson and a $\chionezero$, and neither decay product with have significant \pt. In these cases, there will be very little \met and the leptons will have lower \pt values, so the signal region for this analysis will not be sensitive to the signal. As a consequence of this difference between the $\chionezero$ mass choices for the grids, the models with a fixed $\chionezero$ mass value can be excluded all the way up to the $m(\go) = m(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2})$ line, while for the $\tilde{g}$--$\chionezero$ grid, there is a small amount of unexcluded parameter space close to the line.

In general, the observed exclusions are slightly weaker than the expected exclusions, due to a very small excess of events observed in SRZ. The observed lower limit on $m(\tilde{g})$ is about 1.3 \tev~for models with $m(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2})$ = 500 \gev~for the $\tilde{g}$--$\chitwozero$ grid. The limits worsen slightly at lower values of $m(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2})$ because less \met is produced in these cases. These improve significantly on the previous \ac{ATLAS} exclusion, which used different models for interpretation, but placed a lower limit on $m(\tilde{g})$ at around 900 \gev~for similar $m(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2})$.
