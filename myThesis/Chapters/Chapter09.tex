\label{ch:eventsel} 

The goal of this analysis is to identify events resembling \autoref{fig:simpmodel} in collisions in the ATLAS detector. In order to do this, a \acf{SR} is defined with the goal of maximizing the identification efficiency of signal-like events while minimizing \ac{SM} backgrounds. However, because this analysis reinvestigates an excess of events seen in Run 1 with the ATLAS detector, the signal region was frozen and could not be reoptimized for the new, higher energy data in Run 2. The \ac{SR}, called \textit{SRZ}, was predetermined, including events with two opposite-sign, same-flavor leptons that could reconstruct a mass, \mll, close to that of the $Z$ boson, with the additional requirement of two jets, \met > 225\gev, and \HT, the scalar sum of the \pt of all jets and the leading two leptons in an event, of at least 600\gev. Additionally, a cut on $\Delta\phi(\text{jet}_{12},{\boldsymbol p}\_{\mathrm{T}}^\mathrm{miss})$ was made in order to reduce the number of events with high \met due to mismeasurement of jets. 

Though this \ac{SR} was fixed, the methods used to estimate its expected \ac{SM} backgrounds were not. A series of \acfp{CR} and \acfp{VR} were chosen to make these estimations possible. \acp{CR} are regions in which the collected data can be used to make an estimate of an expected background in the \ac{SR}, while \acp{VR} are used to confirm the efficacy of these methods. Both \acp{CR} and \acp{VR} are designed to minimize contamination from any potential \ac{BSM} processes to ensure that background estimates relying on these regions don't include any potential signal. 

The strategy for estimating the \ac{FS} backgrounds, for example, depends on a series of \acp{CR} and \acp{VR} depicted in \autoref{fig:region_diagrams}. One estimate, the flavor symmetry method, takes data from CR-FS, a diffent-flavor region with slightly wider \mll~bounds than the \ac{SR}, and uses these events to predict the contribution of flavor symmetric processes to SRZ. An independent method called a sideband fit uses a control region CRT to measure the flavor symmetric events outside of the $Z$ mass window, and uses \ac{MC} to extrapolate inside the $Z$ mass window to SRZ. Then, both methods are validated at lower \met with an otherwise identical series of regions, with VRS corresponding to SRZ, VRT corresponding to CRT, and VR-FS corresponding to CR-FS.

Each background estimation requires its own set of these regions, and the full list of regions used in this analysis can be seen in \autoref{tab:regions-z}. In addition to the \ac{FS} regions described above, there is one more \ac{CR}, CR-$\gamma$, which is a photon region used to predict the number of \dyjets events, a process described in \autoref{sec:bg-z}. Additional \acp{VR}, VR-ZZ, VR-WZ, and VR-3L, are introduced in order to validate the backgrounds taken directly from \ac{MC}. There are several additional regions used, for example, in the estimation of the fakes and \dyjets backgrounds, that are defined in their respective sections.

 The flavour combination of the dilepton pair is denoted as either ``SF'' for same-flavour or ``DF'' for different flavour.
 All regions require at least two leptons, unless otherwise indicated.
 In the case of CR$\gamma$, VR-WZ, VR-ZZ, and VR-3L the number of leptons, rather than a specific flavour configuration, is indicated.
The main requirements that distinguish the control and validation regions from the signal region are indicated in bold.
Most of the kinematic quantities used to define these regions are discussed in the text. The quantity $m_{\text{T}}(\ell_{3},\met)$
indicates the transverse mass formed by the \met and the lepton which is not assigned to either of the $Z$-decay leptons. }

\section{Trigger Strategy}
\label{sec:trig_strategy}

In order to collect data for the analysis, triggers must be chosen that provide good efficiency in each of the \ac{SR}, \ac{VR}, and \acp{CR}. This analysis primarily depends on triggers on leptons, which are required in nearly every region. To simplify the application of trigger scalefactors, which correct \ac{MC} yields for a given trigger to match the data efficiencies, events are broken down into a series of kinematic ranges, each with a designated trigger. These regions can be seen in \autoref{tab:trigger_strat}.

In kinematic regions where single lepton triggers are fully efficient, they are preferentially used. In lower-\pt ranges, dilepton triggers are used, targeting either $ee$, $\mu\mu$, or $e\mu$ events. Electron triggers are selected over muon triggers when possible because they have higher efficiencies in most cases.

In CR-$\gamma$, there are no leptons, so an alternate trigger strategy must be used. \autoref{sec:photon_eventsel} describes this triggering scheme, which includes a combination of prescaled and unprescaled photon triggers to allow for the collection of low-\pt \gjets events.
