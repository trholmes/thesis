The pages that follow detail the author's work on the ATLAS experiment from 2011 through 2016, focusing on an analysis of $13 TeV$ proton-proton collisions at the \ac{LHC} looking for Supersymmetry with the ATLAS Detector. 

\paragraph{Chapter 2} outlines the Standard Model of Particle Physics and the benefits of extending it to include Supersymmetry, then continues to describe the motivation behind searching for this particular model. 

\paragraph{Chapter 3} describes the \ac{LHC} and its operation.

\paragraph{Chapter 4} contains descriptions of the many pieces of the ATLAS detector, and how they serve to detect particles coming from \ac{LHC} collisions.

\paragraph{Chapter 5} presents a neural network designed to improve tracking in the ATLAS Pixel Detector, and describes the benefits of its implementation.
